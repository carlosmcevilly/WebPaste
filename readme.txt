WebPaste
========

A sample iOS project showing how to do copy/paste of both simple and
complex items using the UIPasteBoard. In one example, the pasteboard
is populated with items of two different mime types, text and web
format, and after copying to the pastboard, you can navigate to
different paste targets (such as SMS and email) and paste to see
how the appropriate content is pasted for each one, depending on
what the paste target can support.
